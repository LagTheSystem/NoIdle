# NoIdle
A very lite anti-afk script that works on any game that uses W to go forward


## Installation

To Start, download python 3. A good link for Windows (10/11) is [here.](https://ninite.com/pythonx3/) For Mac, click [here](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.10.4/python-3.10.4-macos11.pkg)

**NOTE: Download the file from the release page. The source will have very possibly broken versions**
Once downloaded and installed, open Command Prompt on Windows or terminal on Mac. Next, type in this command:

```bash
  pip install keyboard
```

Next, to start, run the script and click open the game you want to AFK in.
