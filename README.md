# NoIdle
A very lite anti-afk script that works on any game that uses W to go forward


## Installation

To Start, download python 3. A good link is [here](https://ninite.com/pythonx3/)

Once downloaded and installed, open Command Prompt on Windows or terminal on Mac. Next, type in this command:

```bash
  pip install keyboard
```

Next, to start, run the script and click open the game you want to AFK in.
